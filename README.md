**Technical Choices:**
- React Native & Expo: Fast development, cross-platform compatibility, and easy testing.
  I chose this because it allows building both iOS and Android apps quickly with a single codebase.
- Firebase Firestore: Real-time sync, offline persistence, and scalability.
  Chosen for simplicity in cloud data storage and real-time updates for tasks.
- React Hooks: Clean and maintainable state management.
  Helps keep components functional and easy to understand.
- Skeleton Loaders & Optimistic Updates:Smooth and responsive UI even on slow networks.
  Improves UX by showing placeholders and immediate feedback on user actions.
- LinearGradient & Dark Theme: Modern, visually appealing, and consistent UI.
  Enhances the professional look of the app.
